**Bateman**: You like Huey Lewis and the News?

**Allen**: Um, they're okay.

**Bateman**: Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

**Allen**: Hey, Halberstram?

**Bateman**: Yes, Allen?

**Allen**: Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?

**Bateman**: No, Allen.

**Allen**: Is that a raincoat?

**Bateman**: Yes, it is. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself. Hey, Paul!
